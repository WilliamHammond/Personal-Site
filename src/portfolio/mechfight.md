# Renaissance Mech Fight

Renaissance Mech Fight was made for a 48-hour game jam. The theme of the jam was “Duality.”
Originally, you were going to play as an arms dealing selling to both sides while trying to extend the fight for as long as possible.
We ultimately decided to go for a more fun theme where you play as Da Vinci’s assistant and sell his war machines to dueling artists.

This was my first game jam and my first time using Unity.
I implemented the combat logic, game state, and sound effects.
