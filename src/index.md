<h1> William Hammond </h1>

Hi, I'm Will, and I'm an experienced web and game developer.
I've moved up and down the backend web engineering stack and worked on infrastructure, platform, and product teams.
Currently, I'm pursuing my passion for games.
I've had the opportunity to work on Online Services for One More Game and am currently working on integrating services into a custom game engine at Rushdown Studios.
