# William Hammond

Hi, I'm Will, and I'm an experienced backend web engineer.
I've moved up and down the backend web engineering stack and worked on infrastructure, platform, and product teams.
Currently, though, I'm interested in learning new disciplines of computing.
I've been self-studying lower-level programming, game development, and programming languages.

Since most of my experience is in web engineering, my CV will be biased towards that experience, and my portfolio will show my game development experience.
